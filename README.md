# 🌀 Word Drift

**Word Drift** is a mobile-friendly word game built with **React**, **Node.js**, and modern web technologies. Players guess the secret word, receiving **percentage-based feedback** indicating how close each guess is to the actual answer—like a twist on “Wordle meets Hot & Cold.”

## 🚀 Features

- 🎮 Interactive word guessing with similarity percentage feedback
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile devices
- 💡 Game modes: Easy / Hard / Daily Challenge
- 🧠 Intelligent feedback using NLP or string comparison
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multiplayer mode (optional)
- 📊 Scoreboard and guess history

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Player submits a guess
2. The server compares it to the target word
3. Returns a **similarity score**
4. Repeat until the correct word is guessed or max attempts are reached

Similarity is calculated using:
- Levenshtein Distance
- Jaccard Index (n-grams)
- Semantic APIs (e.g., Datamuse, OpenAI)
